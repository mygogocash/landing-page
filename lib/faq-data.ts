    question: "How does GoGoCash cashback work?",
    answer:
      "You earn cashback when you start shopping from GoGoCash and the brand later confirms your order. Browse partners in the app or on the site, tap through to the merchant, check out as usual, and GoGoCash credits your wallet after confirmation so you can withdraw at the minimum shown.",
